Frenemy is a MERN fullstack application that brings these two opposites together based on common activities or interested to a mutual middle ground. It is a nod to knowing there is a rift but still a willingness to connect with someone to bridge the divide. This is valuable because people choose to view the other side as the enemy, instead of as human beings. Perhaps by removing the preconceived notions you might be able to make a connection based on common interests that could balance the scales. Who knows, you might just make a new best Frenemy along the way! </p>
