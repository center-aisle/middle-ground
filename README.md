In a divisive time when so many people seem to be on opposite ends of the spectrum, it comes high time for a middle ground to be reached and genuine connections to be made. Thus the idea of Frenemies was born. Simply enter in a little personal information, take a 16 question survey, and fill out some activites which interest you most. Then all your answers will cycle into our algorithm and from there our database will match you with some other people who you share common interests with yet slightly different political views for bridging a gap.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

1. Clone or Fork and then clone a copy of this repo onto your local machine with 'git clone < repo url >'
2. Download all dependancies with 'npm i'
3. Create a Mongo database and update the config.json file with your database name.
4. In your console navigate to the root folder of the project and enter 'npm run start' to launch the app.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them: Npm install the following dependencies. 

```
1. Express
2. Mongo
3. Mongoose
4. Heroku
5. React-router-dom/React
6. Concurrently
```

### Installing

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
